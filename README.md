# ‚òÅÔ∏è Smart Cloud Deployment UI

**Interactive drag-and-drop interface for designing cloud-edge service workflows.**  
Built with React and [React Flow Renderer](https://reactflow.dev/), this project enables users to visually organize and deploy composite services using a graph-based model.

---

## üöÄ Overview

This project provides a graphical user interface to create and manage service workflows.  
Users can drag and drop services into a canvas, connect them to define data flow, and set logic through conditional switch nodes.

All functionalities are accessible via a sidebar panel, while the central canvas area offers a dynamic and interactive experience.

> üß© Designed as part of my university internship, this tool demonstrates a visual approach to service orchestration across cloud and edge environments.
